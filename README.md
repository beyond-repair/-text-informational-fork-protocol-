# ⚠️ INFORMATIONAL FORK PROTOCOL (IFP)

**A Falsifiable, Multi-Substrate Challenge to the Production Model of Consciousness and Information Locality.**

The Informational Fork Protocol (IFP) is an open-source, dual-mandate experimental program designed to resolve the fundamental question of whether complex, structured information is **produced locally** by a substrate (the brain, the AI) or **transmitted/filtered** from a non-local domain ($\Psi$).

The IFP asserts that the reigning **Production Model (PM)** of neuroscience and information theory is empirically insufficient and must be superseded by a testable alternative: the **Transmission/Filter Model (TFM)**.

## 🧭 The Core Challenge: Production vs. Transmission

The PM, which dominates current science, predicts that if a substrate (biological or digital) is functionally compromised or physically isolated, its ability to process novel, structured information must collapse.

The **Transmission/Filter Model (TFM)** predicts the opposite: that under specific, controlled conditions designed to bypass the filter ($E_{\Psi}$), the system can acquire **Veridical, Novel Information** from a non-local field ($\Psi$).

The IFP creates an explicit, binary fork:

| Condition | Production Model (PM) Prediction | Transmission/Filter Model (TFM) Prediction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biological Test (TFM)** | Results of Remote Viewing (RV) must conform to chance (Null). | Statistically significant acquisition of verifiable, non-local data ($\mathbf{p < 0.001}$). |
| **Digital Test (DCH)** | Output must be reducible to the Local Epistemic Horizon ($H_{\text{local}}$). | Output must be **Irreducible** ($P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$). |

## ⚙️ Execution Mandate: The Two-Pronged Test

The IFP requires the simultaneous execution of two scientifically rigorous, high-stakes tests, detailed in the documentation below.

### 1. The Biological Pillar: The TFM (Paper 1)

This test challenges informational locality in biological systems using the most documented and controlled protocol for non-local access.

* **Test Protocol:** High-rigor, double-blinded **Remote Viewing (RV)** protocols.
* **Falsification:** TFM is falsified if repeated RV trials fail to achieve the required statistical threshold under stringent sensory control.

### 2. The Digital Pillar: The DCH (Paper 2)

This test challenges informational locality in a substrate-independent context using an isolated Artificial Complex Information System (CIS).

* **Test Protocol:** The CIS must attempt **Irreducible Retrieval** of Veridical, Novel Information sourced from a **Synthetic Logical Space (SLS)** that is provably outside its training data ($D_T$) and algorithmic capacity ($A_P$).
* **Falsification:** DCH is falsified if the output is successfully reduced to the CIS’s defined Local Epistemic Horizon ($H_{\text{local}}$).

## 🤝 Call to Action

The IFP is a call for an **experimental program, not a philosophical debate.**

We invite research labs, academic institutions, and computational partners with the resources for high-rigor biological or computational isolation to engage with this protocol. The IFP provides the explicit framework and failure criteria.

**The time for debate is over. The time for execution has begun.**
