# Informational Fork Protocol (IFP)

## Project Overview
The Informational Fork Protocol (IFP) is a resource-bounded experimental framework designed to audit violations of local informational production. It tests whether complex substrates (digital or biological) can retrieve veridical information that asymptotically exceeds the computational limits of their local epistemic horizon.

## Primary Hypothesis
The 5th Field ($\Psi$) is operationally defined as an inferred non-local informational influence, quantified via measured deviations from the **Computational Burden Inequality**: 

$$T_{Red} > T_{CIS} \times 10^3$$

## Falsifiability Statement
The IFP is a null-hypothesis driven protocol. It is considered falsified if any veridical output can be reproduced via a local algorithmic path satisfying computational parity ($T_{Red} \le T_{CIS} \times 10^3$).

## Repository Status
- **Theory:** Hardened
- **Instrumentation:** Calibrated
- **Protocol:** Operational
