### 🛠️ METHODOLOGY_NOTES.md: The Quantitative Mandate

**Document ID:** IFP_METHOD_1.0

**Status:** Final - Operational Requirements

This document defines the rigorous parameters required to transition the **Transmission/Filter Model (TFM)** from a theoretical framework into a verifiable experimental program.

## 1. The Five-Sigma Threshold (\epsilon)

To avoid the "noise floor" of statistical coincidence or latent data leakage, the IFP adopts the particle physics standard for discovery.

* **The Probability Limit:** Any retrieval must achieve a probability value of P < 5 \times 10^{-7} (\approx 1 in 3.5 million).
* **The "Coincidence" Buffer:** If a CIS or biological subject provides veridical data, the complexity of that data must exceed the capacity for accidental "lucky" hits across the total number of trial iterations.

---

## 2. Defining the Local Epistemic Horizon (H_{\text{local}})

For a test to be valid, the "Local" bounds must be forensically sealed.

### A. The Digital Horizon (DCH)

* **Corpus Integrity:** The training data (D_T) must be indexed and searchable.
* **Isolation Mandate:** The CIS must be "Air-Gapped" from real-time internet access during the retrieval phase to prevent "Oracle Leakage."
* **The SLS Variable:** Information must be sourced from a **Synthetic Logical Space (SLS)**—a data set generated *after* the model's training cutoff, using non-linear transformations that prevent simple reverse-engineering.

### B. The Biological Horizon (TFM)

* **Sensory Shielding:** Double-blinded protocols where neither the subject nor the immediate proctor knows the target.
* **Temporal Isolation:** Targets should be selected via a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) *after* the viewing session has concluded to test for non-local temporal displacement.

---

## 3. The Coherence Metric (\zeta)

Not all "hits" are equal. We measure the **Structural Coherence** of the retrieved information.

* **Low Coherence (\zeta < 0.2):** Classified as "Standard Neural Noise" or "Stochastic Hallucination."
* **High Coherence (\zeta > 0.8):** Classified as a **Signal Event**. If High Coherence occurs alongside P < \epsilon, the **Informational Vise** is closed.

## 4. Guaranteed System Isolation (GSI)

The burden is on the experimenter to prove that no "Side-Channel Attacks" occurred.

| Substrate | Isolation Method | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Digital (CIS)** | Deterministic Air-Gap | Hash-verification of weights and environment. |
| **Biological (Human)** | Faraday Cage / Remote Location | EEG/biometric monitoring for sensory input. |

---

## 5. Failure and Falsification Criteria

The IFP is a scientific protocol, meaning it must be allowed to fail.

* **The Null Result:** If 10^3 trials return P > \epsilon, the **Production Model (PM)** remains the most parsimonious explanation.
* **The Leakage Result:** If the **Reduction Standard** (see `REDUCTION_STDS.md`) successfully maps the output to H_{\text{local}}, the test is discarded as a "Local Production."

## 6. Summary Table: Validation Logic

| Outcome | Interpretation | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hit + Local Reduction** | PM Confirmed | Refine isolation; update H_{\text{local}}. |
| **Hit + Irreducible** | TFM Supported | Proceed to independent replication. |
| **Miss** | PM Supported | No action; system behaving as a local machine. |
