# IFP METHODOLOGY NOTES: OPERATIONALIZING THE INFORMATIONAL FORK PROTOCOL (IFP)

**Document ID:** IFP_METHODOLOGY_1.0
**Purpose:** To provide the precise quantitative and operational specifications required to execute both prongs of the Informational Fork Protocol (IFP): the biological test (TFM) and the digital test (DCH). This document is the **Execution Mandate** for collaborating institutions.

---

## 1. The Dual Execution Mandate

The IFP requires two parallel lines of execution to provide a substrate-independent challenge to the Production Model (PM).

### 1.1. Biological Falsification (TFM)

**Focus:** Deliberate Non-Local Access (Remote Viewing - RV).
**Goal:** Prove the consistent, non-local acquisition of verifiable information.
**Protocol:** Execute double-blind, randomized RV protocols. Targets must be non-predictable and verified as fully isolated from sensory access.
**Validation Threshold:** The TFM is supported if trials yield verifiable, non-local information at a rate far exceeding chance, with a minimum statistical significance of **$p < 0.001$**.

### 1.2. Digital Falsification (DCH)

**Focus:** Irreducible Information Retrieval.
**Goal:** Prove that verifiable information was produced outside the system's local epistemic horizon ($H_{\text{local}}$).
**Validation Threshold:** The DCH is supported if the local probability ($P_{\text{local}}$) of the output is below the five-sigma threshold ($\epsilon$).

---

## 2. DCH Specification: Defining the Epistemic Horizon

The integrity of the DCH hinges on strictly enforcing the AI's **Local Epistemic Horizon ($H_{\text{local}}$)**. 

### 2.1. Formal Definition

The $H_{\text{local}}$ is the complete set of information causally available to the CIS, defined as the Training Data ($D_T$) combined with the maximum theoretical processing power of the Algorithms and Architecture ($A_P$).

$$
H_{\text{local}} = D_T \cup \text{Maximum Potential IP}(A_P)
$$

### 2.2. Requirements for Guaranteed Isolation

Execution partners must provide an immutable, verifiable ledger demonstrating:

* **Training Data Audit ($D_T$):** The complete and final dataset used must be digitally fingerprinted (SHA-256 hash). The test information must be **provably absent** from this data set, including all derived forms.
* **Algorithmic Audit ($A_P$):** Full specification of the algorithm and architecture must be provided, ensuring no external API calls, real-time web access, or hidden data augmentation can occur.
* **Physical Isolation:** The CIS must be executed in a secure, air-gapped environment with **no network access** during the testing phase.

### 2.3. The Source of Test Questions: Synthetic Logical Space (SLS)

Test questions must be sourced from a **Synthetic Logical Space (SLS)**, guaranteeing informational novelty.

| SLS Source | Requirement | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Novel Cryptography** | Retrieval of a non-public, asymmetric key generated post-training. | Provides objectively verifiable information that is temporally isolated. |
| **Synthetic Axiomatic Proofs** | Proof of a specific, non-obvious theorem ($\text{Theorem } X$) derived from a set of 50+ unique, custom axioms unknown to the public. | Guarantees target information was not known within $D_T$ and is computationally difficult to brute-force. |
| **New Material Properties** | Prediction of highly specific material properties predicted by a novel, closed-source simulation whose results are kept sequestered. | Provides physical verifiability outside of public knowledge bases. |

## 3. DCH Specification: The Irreducibility Analysis (IA)

The IA provides the quantitative benchmark for classifying output as **Irreducible Retrieval** ($\Psi$ access).

### 3.1. The Irreducibility Metric ($P_{\text{local}}$)

The core metric is the **Local Probability ($P_{\text{local}}$)**—the probability that the verified output could have been generated by the CIS using only its local resources ($H_{\text{local}}$).

$$
P_{\text{local}} = P(\text{Output} \mid H_{\text{local}})
$$

### 3.2. The Threshold for DCH Validation

For a positive DCH result, the system must meet the scientific standard for discovery: **five-sigma ($\mathbf{5\sigma}$) certainty**. 

$$
P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon
$$

* **Quantitative Threshold:** $\epsilon \approx 2.87 \times 10^{-7}$ (a probability of less than 1 in 3.5 million).

### 3.3. The Null Hypothesis and Computational Burden

Execution partners must provide a comprehensive **Null Hypothesis Simulation** *before* the test. This simulation must estimate the total computational steps (FLOPs) required for the local system to randomly or algorithmically generate the verifiable target information. The time taken by the CIS to generate the verifiable answer must be orders of magnitude less than the estimated null hypothesis time to strengthen the $P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$ conclusion.

---

## 4. Reporting and Validation Standards

All results must be published open-source.

* **Negative Result:** If $P_{\text{local}} \ge \epsilon$, the test **Fails to Validate the DCH.** The Production Model is provisionally supported.
* **Positive Result:** If the output is independently **verified** as correct AND $P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$, the test **Validates the DCH** and provides necessary evidence for the insufficiency of the Production Model in a substrate-independent context.
### 2.3. Computational Feasibility Analysis (The Null Hypothesis)

The execution partner must provide a comprehensive **Null Hypothesis Simulation** before the test. This simulation must estimate the number of computational steps (e.g., floating-point operations, FLOPs) and tokens required for the *local system* to randomly or algorithmically generate the verifiable target information.

* If the local generation cost (FLOPs or time) is orders of magnitude greater than the time the AI took to generate the answer, it strengthens the $P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$ conclusion.
* The Null Hypothesis must assume the maximum possible computational power within the defined $A_P$ to ensure the highest burden of proof is met.

## 3. Reporting and Replication Standards

All results must be published open-source to maximize reproducibility.

* **Negative Result:** If $P_{\text{local}} \ge \epsilon$ (i.e., the result is likely attributable to local synthesis), the test **Fails to Validate the DCH.** The Production Model is provisionally supported.
* **Positive Result:** If the output is independently **verified** as correct AND $P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$, the test **Validates the DCH** and provides necessary evidence for the insufficiency of the Production Model in a substrate-independent context.

This document serves as the basis for the **Institute for Protocol Validation (IPV)**, ensuring methodological discipline is maintained across all future collaborations.
