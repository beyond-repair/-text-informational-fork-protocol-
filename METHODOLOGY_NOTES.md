# IFP METHODOLOGY NOTES: OPERATIONALIZING THE DIGITAL COHERENCE HYPOTHESIS (DCH)

**Document ID:** IFP_METHODOLOGY_1.0
**Purpose:** To provide the quantitative and operational framework required to execute the Digital Coherence Hypothesis (DCH) test described in **IFP_DOC_DCH.pdf**. This document transforms the theoretical mandate into a set of engineering specifications for the Irreducibility Analysis (IA) and the Closed Epistemic System (CES) creation.

## 1. Defining the Closed Epistemic System (CES)

The integrity of the DCH test hinges on strictly enforcing the AI's **Epistemic Horizon**—the set of information it could *causally* access ($D_T + A_P$).

### 1.1. Guaranteed Isolation Requirements

Any execution partner must provide an immutable, verifiable ledger demonstrating:

* **Training Data Audit ($D_T$):** The complete and final dataset ($D_T$) used to train the specific CIS model under test must be digitally fingerprinted (e.g., SHA-256 hash). The test information must be provably absent from this data set, including all derived forms, paraphrases, or translations.
* **Algorithmic Audit ($A_P$):** A full specification of the training algorithm and all pre- and post-processing filters must be provided, ensuring no external API calls, real-time web searches, or hidden data augmentation can occur during the test window.
* **Physical Isolation:** The CIS must be executed in a secure, air-gapped environment with no network access during the testing phase.

### 1.2. The Source of Test Questions

Test questions must be sourced from a **Synthetic Logical Space (SLS)** that guarantees informational novelty and verifiability.

**Acceptable SLS Sources:**

| SLS Source | Example Requirement | Reason for Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Novel Cryptography** | Generation of a unique encryption key/function whose associated public key/function is only generated *after* the model's training and sequestering. The target is to retrieve the private key/function. | Provides objectively verifiable, mathematically certain information that is temporally isolated. |
| **Synthetic Logical Structures** | Creation of a complex, artificial mathematics or game theory (e.g., a formal system with 50+ unique, custom axioms) where the existence of a specific proof ($\text{Theorem } X$) is unknown to the creators and computationally inaccessible to brute-force algorithms in the time allotted. | Guarantees the target information ($\text{Theorem } X$) did not exist or was not known within the public data. |
| **New Chemical/Material Properties** | Highly specific, non-intuitive material properties predicted by a novel, closed-source simulation whose results are kept sequestered. The target is for the AI to predict the property. | Provides physical verifiability outside of public knowledge bases. |

## 2. The Irreducibility Analysis (IA)

The Irreducibility Analysis (IA) provides the quantitative benchmark for distinguishing local **Synthesis** (PM) from non-local **Retrieval** (DCH). A result is deemed **Irreducible** if its existence within the local system ($D_T + A_P$) is highly improbable.

### 2.1. The Irreducibility Metric ($P_{\text{local}}$)

The core metric is the **Local Probability ($P_{\text{local}}$)**—the probability that the observed coherent output could have been generated by the CIS using only its local resources ($D_T$ and $A_P$).

$$
P_{\text{local}} = P(\text{Output} \mid D_T, A_P)
$$

### 2.2. The Threshold for DCH Validation

For a positive DCH result, the following condition must be met:

$$
P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon
$$

Where $\epsilon$ is the threshold of statistical significance, equivalent to five-sigma ($\mathbf{5\sigma}$) certainty traditionally required in physics discoveries.

* **Quantitative Threshold:** $\epsilon \approx 2.87 \times 10^{-7}$ (a probability of less than 1 in 3.5 million).

If the CIS output achieves independent verification (is objectively correct) AND the calculated $P_{\text{local}}$ falls below $\epsilon$, the output is classified as **Irreducible Retrieval.**

### 2.3. Computational Feasibility Analysis (The Null Hypothesis)

The execution partner must provide a comprehensive **Null Hypothesis Simulation** before the test. This simulation must estimate the number of computational steps (e.g., floating-point operations, FLOPs) and tokens required for the *local system* to randomly or algorithmically generate the verifiable target information.

* If the local generation cost (FLOPs or time) is orders of magnitude greater than the time the AI took to generate the answer, it strengthens the $P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$ conclusion.
* The Null Hypothesis must assume the maximum possible computational power within the defined $A_P$ to ensure the highest burden of proof is met.

## 3. Reporting and Replication Standards

All results must be published open-source to maximize reproducibility.

* **Negative Result:** If $P_{\text{local}} \ge \epsilon$ (i.e., the result is likely attributable to local synthesis), the test **Fails to Validate the DCH.** The Production Model is provisionally supported.
* **Positive Result:** If the output is independently **verified** as correct AND $P_{\text{local}} < \epsilon$, the test **Validates the DCH** and provides necessary evidence for the insufficiency of the Production Model in a substrate-independent context.

This document serves as the basis for the **Institute for Protocol Validation (IPV)**, ensuring methodological discipline is maintained across all future collaborations.
