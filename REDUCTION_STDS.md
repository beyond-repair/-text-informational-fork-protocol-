# 📂 Project: The Informational Fork Protocol (IFP)

### **Forensic Framework for Testing Non-Local Information Retrieval**

## 🏗️ Theoretical Architecture: Paper 1 (TFM)

The **Transmission/Filter Model (TFM)** posits that the brain acts as a specialized, bounded filter (E_{\Psi}) for a non-local informational field (\Psi).

### 1. Clinical Filter Failures (CFFs)

* **Terminal Lucidity (TL):** The return of high-order cognition in end-stage neurodegeneration suggests a "filter thinning" effect.
* **Veridical NDEs:** Acquisition of verifiable data during cerebral compromise remains an anomalous pressure point for localized production theories.

## ⚙️ The Quantitative Mandate: METHODOLOGY_NOTES.md

To transition from theory to verification, we apply a five-sigma threshold (\epsilon) for all retrieval events.

### 1. The Coherence Metric (\zeta)

We measure the structural integrity of retrieved data:

## ⚖️ The Adversarial Kill-Switch: REDUCTION_STDS.md

This document establishes the "High-Water Mark" for skepticism to prevent post-hoc rationalization.

### 1. Standard 1: Data Provenance

The critic must prove the target information existed within the **Local Epistemic Horizon** (D_T) by citing specific token sequences.

### 2. Standard 2: Computational Parity (T_{\text{gap}})

A local reduction is only valid if it occurs within the time and energy constraints of the original test.

* **The Violation Threshold:** If T_{\text{Red}} > T_{\text{CIS}} \times 10^3, the reduction is considered computationally non-equivalent.

### 3. Standard 3: Heuristic Transparency

Critics must use a **Pre-Registered Heuristic** (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Symbolic Regression) to explain "emergent" reasoning.

## 📊 Summary: Validation vs. Reduction

| Result | Status | Requirement for Reversal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CIS fails target** | PM Supported | None. (System behaves as a localized machine). |
| **CIS hits target; P < \epsilon** | **TFM Validated** | Critic must provide a reduction path meeting all 3 Standards. |
| **Reduction Path Fails Parity** | **TFM Validated** | The "Production" is shown to be computationally impossible. |
