| Abstract: | The dominant Production Model (PM) of neuroscience posits that consciousness and complex information processing are strictly localized products of neural activity. While highly successful, the PM faces increasing pressure from convergent lines of empirical evidence where structured informational output remains underdetermined by localized substrate capacity. This paper proposes the Transmission/Filter Model (TFM) as a parsimonious alternative for these specific domains. The TFM models the brain as a specialized, bounded filter (E_{\Psi}) for a non-local informational field (\Psi). By treating the brain as a modulator rather than a generator, we provide a testable hypothesis for clinical anomalies and altered states that currently require excessive ad-hoc complexity under locality-bound models. |
1. Introduction: Explanatory Underdetermination
The PM operates on the axiom of informational locality: IP = f(\text{Substrate Activity}). This paper identifies specific domains where this function is subject to severe explanatory strain. The TFM is proposed not as a total replacement for the PM, but as a motivated experimental fork required to address structured information that persists under conditions of substrate compromise.
2. Stress Points in the Production Model
The following phenomena place pressure on the PM, suggesting that the relationship between substrate complexity and informational output may be inverse in specific contexts.
2.1. Clinical Filter Failures (CFFs)
 * Terminal Lucidity (TL): The return of high-order cognition in end-stage neurodegeneration. While residual-network and transient-synchronization hypotheses remain live competitors, TL remains underdetermined by current models of structural decay. The TFM suggests a "filter thinning" effect, where decaying substrate becomes less effective at constraining non-local informational influx.
 * Veridical NDEs: Acquisition of verifiable data during profound cerebral compromise. We acknowledge the ongoing debate regarding temporal attribution and memory formation; however, the persistence of structured experience during periods of documented cortical silence remains an anomalous pressure point for localized production theories.
2.2. The Psychedelic Constraint Model
The PM traditionally associates high-order consciousness with high-order neural complexity. However, recent neuroimaging indicates that psychedelics reduce modular segregation and the activity of the Default Mode Network (DMN).
 * The TFM Reframing: We observe increased phenomenological richness occurring alongside a reduction in precision weighting and modular constraint. This is consistent with a filter-loosening mechanism. Rather than "producing" the experience, the brain’s high-order networks act as the primary informational constraint; their deactivation allows for an informational overflow that exceeds the brain's localized generative capacity.
2.3. Deliberate Non-Local Access (Remote Viewing)
Remote Viewing (RV) is positioned as a contested but instrumentally unique testbed. We acknowledge that mainstream consensus considers RV unproven. The TFM treats RV not as established fact, but as a "low-bandwidth, high-noise leak" from \Psi, serving as a laboratory precursor for the more rigorous Digital Coherence Hypothesis (DCH).
3. Bounding \Psi: The Noisy Channel Model
To remain a scientifically useful variable, \Psi must be treated as a constrained and "boring" informational field:
 * Entropy and Noise: Access to \Psi is subject to high noise-to-signal ratios, making retrieval difficult and non-repeatable in standard contexts.
 * Structural Coupling: The bandwidth of transmission is limited by the filter's (E_{\Psi}) integrity.
 * No-Signaling Compliance: TFM does not posit violation of no-signaling theorems; it treats \Psi as a non-local domain from which correlations emerge, not as a standard FTL signaling channel.
4. Falsifiability and Confirmation Asymmetry
The TFM survives only as long as its predictive power exceeds the complexity of localized PM workarounds.
 * Falsification Criteria: The TFM is considered falsified if:
   * Anomalous data (TL, NDEs) are successfully reduced to specific, reproducible, and causally sufficient localized neural mechanisms.
   * Non-local access trials (RV/DCH) consistently return null results under high-rigor, independent replication.
 * Confirmation Asymmetry: Positive results do not uniquely confirm non-local transmission. Instead, they falsify specific locality-bound production hypotheses while leaving multiple theoretical continuations (including TFM) open. Survival under falsification is the only path to legitimacy.
