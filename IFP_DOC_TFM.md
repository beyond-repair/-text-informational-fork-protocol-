# 📄 PAPER_1: The Transmission/Filter Model (TFM)
**Document ID:** IFP_DOC_TFM.1.1  
**Status:** Operational Draft  

## 1. Abstract
The Transmission/Filter Model (TFM) addresses biological anomalies where informational order ($O_{inf}$) remains stable or paradoxically increases despite significant substrate (neurological) degradation. TFM hypothesizes that biological substrates function as high-impedance filters for a non-local informational field ($\Psi$).

## 2. The Inversion of the Production Model
The standard Production Model (PM) predicts a monotonic degradation:
$$\downarrow S_{int} \implies \downarrow O_{inf}$$

TFM identifies **Discontinuity Events** (e.g., Terminal Lucidity) where:
$$\downarrow S_{int} \implies \uparrow O_{inf} \text{ (Measured as } \zeta > 0.9 \text{)}$$



## 3. Substrate Impedance and $\zeta$
In biological systems, $\zeta$ (Coherence) is inversely proportional to substrate interference.
* **Metabolic Proxy:** Standard waking states require high neural firing density (interference) to maintain a local ego-filter.
* **Impedance Reduction:** Physiological shifts (e.g., hypoxia, pharmacological inhibition, or structural trauma) may reduce this local filter. This is measured via EEG power variance and neural entropy proxies.

## 4. Forensic Markers for TFM Audit
Anomalous biological events are audited using the [REDUCTION_STDS.md](./REDUCTION_STDS.md) logic:
1. **Zero-Day Validation:** Was the information retrieved by the subject during a period of documented substrate failure unavailable to their local senses?
2. **Computational Impossibility:** Does the retrieved data (e.g., veridical NDE retrieval) exceed the sensory/memory capacity of the degraded substrate?

## 5. Summary
TFM posits a **Substrate-Independent Signal**. If biological degradation leads to high-fidelity, veridical information retrieval, the substrate is functionally verified as a filter (modulator), not a generator.
